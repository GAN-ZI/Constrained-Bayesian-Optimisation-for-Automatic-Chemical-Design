This directory contains the data used to train the binary classification neural network.

The positive labels are generated by decoded the latent points representing the training data.

The negative labels are generated by decoding latent points generated uniformly at random across the latent space.
The bounds of this uniform distribution are the lowest and highest values found in the training data across each
dimension.

The text files max_lims.txt and min_lims.txt contain the limits of the uniform distribution over the 56 latent
dimensions from which X_sampled.txt was generated.
